![Highrise? Highrise!](https://github.com/CrazyCSIW6/iw4c6-raw/assets/51261276/506b1df9-da97-4c70-9230-ae23feab0e59)

## About IW4C6
IW4C6 is a singleplayer and multiplayer semi-total conversion mod for IW4x MP.
The goal of IW4C6 is to keep the charm of the early MW2 era alive, fully offline (but the idea is that you shouldn't even notice).
IW4C6 includes an unfinished recreation of the UI and menus from the day-one Xbox 360 version.
All the old glitches are back, same goes for the balancing (or lack thereof)

As an added bonus you can play with friends and kick ass (including each others' asses), as well as go solo and tell the bots to suck it. And yes, they'll do the same to you. Not all games have to be easy.
