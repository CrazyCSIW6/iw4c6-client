## About IW4C6
IW4C6 is a fork of IW4x MP that aims to recreate the charm and experience of Modern Warfare 2's early days.
IW4C6 includes a recreation of the UI and menus from the day-one Xbox 360 version. All the glitches have been restored, and patches have been reverted.
As an added bonus, bots are included (forked from Bot Warfare) and you can either go solo, or play with and against your friends.
