## About IW4C6
IW4C6 is a singleplayer and multiplayer mod for IW4x MP.
The goal of IW4C6 is to keep the charm of the early MW2 era preserved in a fully offline state (but the idea is that you shouldn't even notice).
IW4C6 includes an unfinished recreation of the UI and menus from the day-one Xbox 360 version.
All the glitches have been restored, and patches have been reverted.
As an added bonus you can play with friends and kick ass, as well as go solo and tell the bots to suck it. Yes, they do the same to you.
